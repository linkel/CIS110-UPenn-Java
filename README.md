## CIS 110

Hey, I'm essentially done with this course! I wrote out a 2048 clone in Java using Swing, and it was quite a mess of code. I feel a bit bad about not prettying it up more, but I'm glad I had the experience playing with Swing, repainting, JFrames, and having to structure out the logic for something entirely from scratch. I am moderately pleased that I wrote this out without looking at anyone else's code for the logic. 

The LFSR encryption homework was also fun. Overall, I really liked everything in this.

## What I wrote in March/April 2019

This course has been pretty fun so far! I really enjoyed HW07 with the traveling salesman problem and using linked lists and inserting in different fashions for three heuristics. Would like to revisit the extra credit sometime. 

Two projects left--the encryption one and the game final project. Looking forward to checking out the Java and OCaml course after this! 

## What I wrote in the beginning of the course, around December(?):

I found the [webpage](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/18fa/index.html) for CIS 110 when I was looking for a course on Rust. The Rust course that UPenn offers recommended a prequisite that consisted of Java and OCaml, and the prerequisite for that course specified CIS 110. After some deliberation, I figured it might be fun to expose myself to Java again since it's been 5 years since I touched it back at UCSD in an intro course I took for fun. So even though my original objective was to find an online Rust course, it can't be a bad thing for me to familiarize myself with Java. 

I don't know how long the webpage will stay up, so I had better get cracking!
