## CIS 110

I found the [webpage](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/current/) for CIS 110 when I was looking for a course on Rust. The Rust course that UPenn offers recommended a prequisite that consisted of Java and OCaml, and the prerequisite for that course specified CIS 110. After some deliberation, I figured it might be fun to expose myself to Java again since it's been 5 years since I touched it back at UCSD in an intro course I took for fun. So even though my original objective was to find an online Rust course, it can't be a bad thing for me to familiarize myself with Java. 

I don't know how long the webpage will stay up, so I had better get cracking!
